          <h3 class="pb-3">Effects on BYSAP shopping</h3>
          <p>The COVID-19 global pandemic is likely one of the defining events of 2020/1,
            and that it will have implications that last well into the decade. The situation is
            rapidly changing. The amount of people considered safe to gather in a single place has
            diminished from thousands, to hundreds, to ten. Restaurants, bars, movie theaters, and
            gyms in many major cities are shutting down. Meanwhile many office workers are facing
            new challenges of working remotely full time. <br /></br>

            As people have embraced social distancing as a way to slow the spread of the pandemic,
            there has naturally been a drop-off in shopping physically. That would seem to mean
            there would likely be an increase in online shopping as people turn to ecommerce to purchase
            the items they might have otherwise purchased in person. This increase in consumers request and the
            shut off of the market stock places has caused BYSAP to face problem managing product as the products in stock
            decreases day by day. We are looking on to this problem thorougly and will continue providing services to
            our customers in this time of pandemic.<br /></br></p>
